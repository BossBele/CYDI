        Note to you:
      </h3>
      <p>
        We members of CYDI are committed to promote and support socio-economic
        inclusion and empowerment of children and youth on all matters that
        allow young people to have greater control over their destinies
        individually and collectively and develop their abilities to effectively
        contribute towards advancement of socio-economic sustainable development
        in Tanzania in accordance to SDGs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>WHERE AS:</b> Tanzania is faced with the task of harnessing the
        potential of its youth population to accelerate its development in a way
        that would provide opportunities for their substantive contribution
        towards sustainable development, the majority of young people still face
        high levels of unemployment, poverty, prevalent diseases like HIV AIDS,
        functional illiteracy and drug abuse among other social and economic
        challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>AND CONSIDERING:</b> that the majority of children and young people
        especially in rural and remote areas live in extreme poverty facing
        daily unacceptable conditions of hunger and malnutrition, diseases,
        homelessness, unsafe environment and exclusion due to inequality in
        economic conditions and societal imbalances subjecting them to greater
        marginalization.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>CONSCIOUS:</b> of the importance of children and young people having
        access to quality basic education, including life skills, ICT,
        entrepreneurship and business skills, access to child and youth friendly
        healthcare and health education, promotion of sustainable development
        and conservation and protection of the environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>CONSCIOUS:</b> of the need of children and young people being given
        access to resources and enabling environment to tackle personal and
        societal challenges that face them;
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>BEING AWARE:</b> that children and youth NGOs are the best agents of
        delivering change to children and the youth with volunteerism and
        participation being key to promoting children and youth development
        through peer to peer training, support and facilitation of the role of
        marginalized and vulnerable children and youth in the wider society;
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>MINDFUL:</b> of the fact that education, training and capacity
        building of children and youth are of paramount importance in the
        provision of long term strategy in poverty eradication;
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>MINDFUL:</b> of the fact that it is now desirable, that CYDI be made
        known to the general public through the media, workshops, seminars,
        conferences, meetings and many other means.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>WE DO HEREBY</b> adopt and give to ourselves our constitution as a
        basis for the realization of our herein below declared objectives. We
        founder members of CYDI are determined to do all that is necessary to
        support and empower the socio-economic inclusion of children and youth
        towards sustainable development.
      </p>

        <br />
